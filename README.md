# Stasher backend test

You've been asked to look at this legacy API code because a subset of customers are complaining that they're not able to log in, but no-one has investigated it yet. This code is running in an old production instance somewhere as you see it (the only thing different being the docker-compose file). Can you find the issues?

The objectives are:

- Can you find any bugs? What are they?
- Is there anything wrong with the way the api code is written?
- Is this configured securely?
- Do you have any recommendations about how to make this better and explain why?

You can use this postman collection to interact with the api: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/d9227c7817de311b9d97

Don't worry if you don't know specifics about `django-rest-framework`, we're just looking to see your general approach.
